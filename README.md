MPtechs POS System
About The Project
MPtechs is a robust Point of Sale (POS) system tailored for efficient sales management and inventory control. The system is designed to cater to two main user categories: administrators and cashiers. Administrators possess full database access and oversee system configurations, while cashiers manage sales transactions and inventory updates.

How the System Works
Administrators have the authority to create user profiles, manage product listings, and configure system settings. Cashiers utilize the system for processing sales transactions, updating inventory levels, and managing customer interactions. Both admin and cashier roles contribute to the seamless operation of the system.
