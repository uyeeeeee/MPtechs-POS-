MPtechs POS System

MPtechs Point of Sale (POS) System Overview: MPtechs is a powerful POS system designed to facilitate effective inventory control and sales management. Cashiers and administrators are the two primary user groups that the system is intended to support. While cashiers handle sales transactions and inventory changes, administrators maintain system setups and have complete database access.

How the System Works
The ability to modify product listings, establish user profiles, and alter system settings is granted to administrators. The technology is used by cashiers to handle client contacts, update inventory levels, and conduct sales transactions. The cashier and administrative positions both play a part in the system's smooth operation.
